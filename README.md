# Improvement of Ransomware Detection using Machine Learning

# Abstract:
A challenge that governments, enterprises as well as individuals are constantly facing is the growing threat of ransomware attacks. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the user’s files and then demands a huge sum of money from the user. This increasing complexity calls for more advancement and innovative ideas in defensive strategies used to tackle the problems. In this paper, firstly we discuss the existing research in the field of ransomware detection techniques and their shortcomings. Secondly, a juxtaposed study on various machine learning algorithms to detect ransomware attacks is explained. Various behavioural data such as API Calls, Target files, Registry Operations, Signature, Network Accesses were collected for each ransomware and benign sample. These collected samples were used to train Machine Learning Algorithms like KNN, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Trees. Further optimization was done using hyperparameters. Finally, we have used the model(s) Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision and Recall to compare the results observed. The acquired result can be used further for the improvement of various antivirus systems in detecting ransomware softwares.
